## ðŸ‘¾ AI Chatbot (Experimental Project)

Welcome! This is a simple web-based AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model. It's an experimental project I'm using to learn and share how modern language models can be integrated into web applications.

## ðŸ¦Š Why I Built This

I'm curious about the intersection of AI, web technologies, and user experience. This chatbot is a small but fun project where I'm experimenting with:
- Calling the OpenAI API from the browser
- Building lightweight static sites
- Sharing tools that spark conversation
