Ophelia's Assistant (Chatbot) 

## 👾 AI Chatbot (Experimental Project)

Welcome! This is a simple web-based AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model. It's an experimental project I'm using to learn and share how modern language models can be integrated into web applications.

## 🦊 Why I Built This
In memory of my beloved cat ZaiZai, who passed away on July 6th,2025. Creating this space helps me hold on to his spirit and share a little joy with others.

## 🐼 A Little about Me:  
I'm curious about the intersection of AI, web technologies, and user experience. This chatbot is a small but fun project where I'm experimenting with:
- Calling the OpenAI API from the browser
- Building lightweight static sites
- Sharing tools that spark conversation
